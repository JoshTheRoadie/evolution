# evolution
This is a simple evolution simulator that I coded for fun.  There are two versions here,
EvolutionSim.py and EvolutionSim_old.py.  The old version I wrote when I was first learning
Python and the newer version has been partially refactored using techniques that I did not 
know at the time.
